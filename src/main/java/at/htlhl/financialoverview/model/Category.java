/**
 * The {@code Category} class represents a category entity in the 'categories' table of the 'financial_overview' PostgreSQL database.
 * It is a POJO (Plain Old Java Object) or entity class that maps to the database table.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is annotated with the {@link Entity} annotation, indicating that it is an entity class to be managed and persisted in the database.
 * The {@link Table} annotation specifies the name of the table in the database that corresponds to this entity.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class contains several fields representing category properties, such as category name and category description.
 * It also includes many-to-one relationships with the {@link Colour} and {@link User} classes, where a category belongs to a colour and a user.
 * It also has a one-to-many relationship with the {@link Subcategory} class, where a category can have multiple subcategories associated with it.

/**
 * <i>@Entity is an annotation used to mark a Java class as an entity class. An entity class represents a table in the database. It typically corresponds to a row in the table and provides a way to interact with the data stored in the table. By applying the annotation you indicate that instances of this class can be managed and persisted in the database.</i>
 * <br>
 * <i>@Table is an annotation used to specify the details of the table associated with an entity class.
 * The 'name' attribute within the annotation specifies the name of the table in the database that corresponds to the entity. In this case, the 'entries' table will be associated with the entity class where this annotation is applied.</i>
 * <br>
 * <i>By combining these two annotations, you are indicating that the Java class is an entity and should be mapped to the specified table name in the database. The JPA implementation will then use this information to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and manage the persistence of instances of this entity class in the database table.</i>

/**
 * The @SecondaryTable annotation is used to specify a secondary table for an entity in Java Persistence API (JPA). It allows you to map additional columns from a secondary table to the same entity. The name attribute is used to specify the name of the secondary table.
 * In the case of @SecondaryTable(name = "colours", pkJoinColumns = @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn(name = "fk_category_colour_id")), it means that the entity is associated with a secondary table named "colours". The pkJoinColumns attribute is used to specify the primary key join column(s) between the main table and the secondary table. In this case, @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn(name = "fk_category_colour_id") specifies that the column "fk_category_colour_id" in the main table is used as the primary key join column.
 * So, when the entity is fetched or persisted, the corresponding columns from the secondary table will be included and mapped to the entity's fields or properties.
